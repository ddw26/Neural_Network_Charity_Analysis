# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

With my working knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I have been tasked to use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We kick started the analysis with a CSV file from Alphabet Soup's business team. Inside the CSV was more than 34,000 organizations that has received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. We used the data to cultivate and train a neural network.
